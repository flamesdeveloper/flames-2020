    - title: Respect
      text: >
        Respect each other as team players, respect our coaches, managers,
        scorers, referees, & spectators.
    - title: Commitment
      text: >
        Expect each player to be committed to not only each match, but also
        weekly training sessions. Each player must be committed to playing as a
        team player rather than an individual.
    - title: Integrity
      text: |
        Play each match with honesty and strong moral principles.
