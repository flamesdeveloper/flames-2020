We're always looking for parents to help out and participate, even if it's just by coming along to the AGM or letting us know what you'd like to see happening at the club. A great way to find out more and get involved is to have a browse at the club rules and see how it all works - it's easier to be a part of the team than you may think.

All players, parents, coaches, and other members of the club are expected to abide by our code of conduct at all times. St Jude's Flames promotes the values of good sportsmanship and friendly competition and we expect members to behave in alignment with these values and rules.
